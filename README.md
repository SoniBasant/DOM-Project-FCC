# DOM-Project-FCC-Youtube

This project series is based on the freecodecamp youtube video for DOM (Document Object Model). The educator explain about the DOM's functionality and its concept at first half of the video and make project at the second half.

I added my content and style along with that present in the video. So, **THIS IS NOT A COPY PASTE WORK**. I learned a lot from these projects. Good for the people who wants to learn DOM from the very basic.

This series has five projects. Video is in FCC account dated 07 JUL 2022 titled "JavaScript DOM Manipulation- Full Course for Beginners". Here is the link of youtube video -
