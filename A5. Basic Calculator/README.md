# Basic Calculator

This is a solution to one of the basic project, **Calculator**. Having it in list of project doesn't matter to people. But it is necessary to make it even if you can't include it in your portfolio. A good practice project.

## Overview

I build this calculator without using **eval()** operation. I used string methods with if-else to work on logical part.

This is basic calculator where you can perform one mathematical operation at a time.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Concepts Used

- getElementById()
- querySelectorAll()
- forEach()
- addEventListener() > submit, click
- preventDefault()
- if...else
- e.target.value
- arrow function
- parseFloat()
- switch()
- logical OR ||
- :root
- radial-gradient() > to make mesh background

String methods >

- indexOf()
- includes()
- slice()

### Continued development

Need to optimize the code.

We should be able to input values also from the keyboard.

As for more than one operation, there will be a new calculator.

Your suggestions are welcome. üôå

## Acknowledgments

As for the styling and color selection of calculator, I take it from an article/video from _freecodecamp_. There JavaScript part is not working properly so I code it myself.
