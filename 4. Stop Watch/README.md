# 4. Stop Watch

With this stop watch you can start time with *Play* button, *Pause* time and *Play* again and can start from *Zero* with *Reset* button.

I improve functionality of this stop watch as compared to tutorial. Before, if you start time by clicking play button and then pause it and click reset button, play button will remain pause button. I corredted it. Now after clicking reset button, you can have play button instead of pause button.

**Future work:** Change background color of time area to improve visibility.
