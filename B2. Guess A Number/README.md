## Overview

In **Guess A Number**, a `random` number (from 1 to 100; both included), is generated by computer. You need to guess the number. You can try as much time as you want.

Your input should be a positive number, you will be informed with a **message** if that happen.

If your guess is lower or higher, you will be informed accordingly.

And when your guess match with the random number generated, a **Reset** button will appear so that you can play again.

There is a **counter** at the bottom of the page to display number of attempts. It will show when you start playing;

## My process

After initial setup, I generate a `random` number. Make a function to check all the `conditions` and call it with the `event` of click on button.

In the function, first I `get` the input `value`, your guess. This is inside function because if I try to get it before click event, we will get a default value and not the input value.

About the `conditions`, I checked if input -

- lower than 0
- higher than 100
- lower than random number
- higher than random number
- any kind of other invalid input

You will see a `message` on different colours when these conditions are true.

- equal to guess value

When your answer is right, you will see a `message` as well as a `reset` button to play again. I used **location.reload()** to reload the page.

In the game, you will see your guess attempts as `count` at the bottom of the page.
